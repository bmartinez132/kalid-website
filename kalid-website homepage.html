	<h2> All About Us</h2>
	<br>
		<p>Hello, we are Kalib. Kalib is a group name, our members are Bridgette Martinez, Kylie Chow, and Karen Cazares. We got together in a group project for Girls Who Code. Our goal here is to create a creative outlet for teens!
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>

	<br>
	<h1>Our Purpose</h1>
		<p>Mental illness is something that is close to all of our hearts since so much stigma surrounds those who have mental illnesses. Being a teenager, who has an undiagnosed mental illness, makes life harder than it should be. The most important thing is to be able to find help. We want you all to express yourself in a safe environment where others can hear you out and support you. </p>
	<br></br>
