At the National Council of Behavioral Health's Hill Day in Washington, D.C. she said, "I just think mental illness is something people need to learn more about. I want people to know it's okay to ask for help and it's okay to have a mental illness. I think it's important that people no longer look at mental health as something taboo to talk about..."</p>

	<h3>Kristen Stewart</h3>
		<p>The actress opened up about dealing with anxiety. "Between ages 15 and 20, it was really intense. I was constantly anxious. I was kind of a control freak.

	<h3>Zayn Malik</h3>
		<p>He spoke about struggling with anxiety and an eating disorder. Even admits that "people don't expect it from a guy." His anxiety has even led him to cancel concerts. Zayn Malik said: "I have been working over the last three months to overcome my extreme anxiety around major live solo performances. I don't have it in me to feel secure in anything I do. I always strive towards something better. It's why I sometimes come across the wrong way- a bit distant. I'm stressed out trying to control how I'm perceived."
